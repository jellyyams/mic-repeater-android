# Amplifying Doctors' Voices in the Fight Against COVID-19

In response to the current shortage of N95 medical masks, the
[Prakash Lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/) at Stanford University is
developing a [novel face mask](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J22le3dBZBnNDXGlJLRb38z7v7LaOjKfDeN9f0tFeKY)
for use in the fight against [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).
Those at Stanford and across the world are converting full-face snorkel masks into medical-grade
reusable masks.

One downside of the mask is that it severely muffles the voice of the user, thereby inhibiting
communication and requiring the user to strain their voice to communicate with others in a noisy
environment. In order to help sound travel past the mask, we created a mobile app to relay audio from
a Bluetooth microphone inside the mask to speakers outside the mask. Sound can either be played on
the phone’s internal speakers or through speakers connected to the device’s wired headphone jack.

As it currently stands, we only have a version of the app for Android. An iOS version of the app is
under development and a beta version should be released within a week.

# Getting the app

We are currently waiting for Google to approve the release of our app to the Play Store. In the
meantime, you can download and install the APK with the following instructions.

1. Download the beta version of the app by visiting
   [http://kylecombes.com/app-debug.apk](http://kylecombes.com/app-debug.apk) on your phone.
2. Open the download. Your phone should prompt you to allow installations from unknown (i.e.
   non-Google Play) sources. If it does, simply follow the on-screen instructions. If no such prompt
   appears and the installation merely fails, do the following:
     * Allow app installations from unknown sources by going to your phone’s Settings -> Security ->
       Unknown Sources and enable installations. This setting might have a different name, depending
       on your version of Android and device manufacturer.
     * Try to install the app again by re-opening the download or revisiting the link above.


# Using the app

 1. Connect phone to a Bluetooth device with a microphone. We recommend using cheap Bluetooth
    headphones, which can be put inside a sterilized plastic bag,  and placed inside the face
    compartment of the snorkel mask. 
 2. (Optional, for extra amplification) Connect an external speaker to the phone’s wired headphone
    jack using an aux cord. If you do not do this, the phone will use its internal speakers.
 3. Open the app.
 4. If the app detects a Bluetooth device capable of streaming audio, it will say “Bluetooth ready.”
    If it does not, follow the on-screen instructions to ensure your device is connected properly.
 5. Click “Start” to begin relaying audio from the microphone to the speaker.
 6. You may now turn off the phone’s screen or switch to another app if you would like. If you need
    to switch speakers at any point, click “Stop,” do any plugging/unplugging, and then click “Start.”
 7. Click “Stop” end relaying audio.
